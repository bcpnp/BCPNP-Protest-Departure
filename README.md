# Reflections and Disclaimer on My Departure from the BCPNP Protest Movement

## Introduction

The journey I embarked upon with the BCPNP protest movement was initiated from a place of genuine concern and advocacy for international students impacted by abrupt policy changes in British Columbia. My involvement was fueled by principles of fairness, transparency, and justice. This document outlines the circumstances that led to my decision to withdraw from the movement, emphasizing my non-involvement in financial activities and highlighting legal disclaimers.

## Legal Disclaimer and Non-Involvement in Fundraising

**Please note:** I have never been involved in any financial transactions, fundraising activities, or monetary collections associated with the BCPNP protest movement. My contributions were solely in the capacity of advocacy, web development, and content creation based on factual information and personal convictions.

I expressly distance myself from any fundraising links, financial solicitations, or monetary activities undertaken by the movement or associated individuals after my departure. My decision to leave is significantly influenced by the introduction of financial elements which I believe could compromise the movement's integrity and transparency.

## Core Reasons for Departure

### Shift in Movement's Direction

The introduction of fundraising efforts, alongside a notable shift in the protest's direction influenced by external parties, conflicts with my original vision for the movement. My concerns regarding the transparency and management of funds have not been addressed to my satisfaction, leading to increased discomfort with my continued association.

### Concerns Over Content and Website Replication

The unauthorized replication of content from the website I developed for the movement, without acknowledgment or permission, undermines the principles of respect and transparency I advocate for. This action, coupled with a lack of communication regarding such decisions, has further solidified my choice to depart.

### External Influence and Control

The involvement of entities with potential commercial or political interests in influencing the movement’s direction is alarming. My attempts to caution against these influences were disregarded, underscoring a divergence from the movement's grassroots ethos.

## Concluding Statement and Forward Path

My withdrawal from the BCPNP protest movement is a decision made after careful consideration, rooted in a desire to maintain my ethical standards and legal standing. I urge current participants to remain vigilant about the movement’s core values and the transparency of its operations, especially regarding financial dealings.

Though I am stepping away, my commitment to advocating for fair treatment and transparent policies for international students remains unwavering. I will continue to support these ideals outside the confines of the BCPNP protest movement.

This document serves as a formal declaration of my non-involvement in any financial activities associated with the BCPNP protest movement and a disclaimer of any legal liabilities related to fundraising or financial transactions from the time of my departure onwards.
